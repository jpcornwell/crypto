Hello, this is some sample text to test out the code
for cracking repeating key xor. This has to have english
text instead of lorem ipsum because lorem ipsum could mess
up the frequency analysis that my code does. I have no idea
how long this needs to be for it to be accurate. So I will
keep typing some more text in here. Then I am going to apply
repeating key xor to it, and then try to crack it and see if
the key size and key contents are properly guessed. Okay this
is probably enough now. Also, I could use this for things
other than repeating key xor.
